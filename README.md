# Pacman_x86
This project is a simplified Pacman game implemented in x86 Assembly using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler). It includes features such as:

Basic game mechanics for controlling Pacman and handling ghosts
File handling to save game scores in "ScoreRecord.txt"
Efficient memory usage and game state management using flags and custom logic
The project demonstrates low-level programming techniques using assembly for handling a classic game, offering insights into system-level operations. â€‹
